Status Update: Tailwind CSS Upgrade

We encountered issues with Just-in-Time (JIT) mode not functioning properly in our Nx 19 environment with Tailwind CSS v2.0.4.

Action Taken:

Upgraded Tailwind CSS to version 3.x

Implemented the new tw- prefix functionality

Updated all relevant configuration files

Current Status:
âœ… Tailwind CSS is now working as expected with:

Proper JIT mode functionality

Successful prefix implementation ("tw-")
