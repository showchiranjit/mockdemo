Current Status: Exploring Nx Monorepo & Investigating TailwindCSS Issue

I'm currently working with an Nx monorepo and investigating why TailwindCSS isn't loading properly in our application.

Steps Taken:

Followed the official documentation for setting up TailwindCSS in the Nx monorepo.

Verified configurations, but the styles are still not being applied as expected.

Next Steps:

Double-check PostCSS and Tailwind configurations.

Review module dependencies and build processes.

Debug potential path or scoping issues.
