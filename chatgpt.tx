Subject: Clarification on ServiceType Behavior During Driver Return

Hi Team,

Iâ€™d like to clarify the expected behavior of the servicetype field in the API when a driver returns to the store after delivering an order.

Currently, when the driver starts returning to the store, does the servicetype switch to "delivery", or should it reflect "customer return" since we anticipate a return scenario?

Additional question: If the driver has already delivered the order and begins returning to the store, will the servicetype change to "customer return" during the return trip, or will it remain as "delivery"?

How can we determine if a driver is en route to the store if this is standard behavior?

Also, regarding the tenant URL logo: Is it possible to update it with an SVG file instead of the current format?

Could you please confirm the expected behavior and any limitations around the logo format?

Thanks in advance for your help!

Best regards,
[Your Name]
