You are working on a monorepo using Nx that needs to support Next.js 14, which has a dependency on React 18. However, there is a living design system component in your project that depends on React 17. This creates a conflict because:

Next.js 14 requires React 18.

React 17 and React 18 cannot coexist in the same project due to version mismatches.

If you force React 18, the living design system (which depends on React 17) will fail.

If you stick with React 17, Next.js 14 will fail to build, run, or test.

This situation requires a proper migration plan to resolve the dependency conflicts.

Key Points
Next.js 14 Dependency:

Next.js 14 requires React 18. If you try to use React 17, the build, run, and test commands will fail.

Living Design System Dependency:

The living design system depends on React 17. If you upgrade to React 18, the design system will fail.

Conflict:

React 17 and React 18 cannot coexist in the same project because they have breaking changes and different internal implementations.
